# Week 2: Big Data and (Social) Science

## Discussion Prompts

The world is governed by immutable laws. With enough information about the initial conditions, nothing is unpredictable and every outcome is necessary. Discuss.

Probabilities are just statements of subjective ignorance. When I say there's a 50% chance it will rain tomorrow, I simply mean that for all I know, it's as likely as not that it will rain tomorrow. Discuss.

Observational data is never sufficient to infer a causal relationship between two variables. Discuss.

## Reading Questions

In a famous 2008 cover article in _WIRED_, then editor-in-chief Chris Anderson hailed the arrival of big data as "The End of Theory":

> Out with every theory of human behavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and psychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. (Anderson, 2008)

In an article published the same year, David Freedman more or less argues the opposite:

> Informal reasoning, qualitative insights, and the creation of novel data sets that require deep substantive knowledge and a great expenditure of effort and shoe leather have pivotal roles. Many breakthroughs came from recognizing anomalies and capitalizing on accidents, which require immersion in the subject. Progress means refuting old ideas if they are wrong, developing new ideas that are better, and testing both. Qualitative insights can play a key role in all three tasks. Combining the qualitative and the quantitative -- and a healthy dose of skepticism -- may provide the most secure results. (Freedman 2008, p. 300)

Who's right? Is theory more important in some subject areas than others? Why?
