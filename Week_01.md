# Week 1: Big Data and (Free Information) Markets

For starters, here are Wikipedia pages on Weber's theory of  [rationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(sociology)), Marx's theory of [alienation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation), and the [Panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon). 

## Discussion Questions

Companies have always tried to target consumers to the best of their ability. How, if at all, have the internet and mobile technologies changed this dynamic? 
* The use of mobile technologies means the possiblity of collecting data at all times and at closer proximity. Companies have access to much more consumer data.
* Micro-targeting is more efficient for consumers and firms, but also leads to a state of perpetual surveillance.
* The rise of big data has incentivized a logic of quantification (rationalization) that distorts social realities.
* The advantages of data-rich firms entrenches the market power of incumbents and makes a winner-take-all dynamic.
* Granularity of data allows for new modes of discrimination.

What are some of the benefits of data-rich markets?
* Better fit between consumer preferences and products (more information can be processed compared to markets based solely on prices)
* Targeted offers, marketing, discounts
* Less time spent searching if companies know what we want
* Algorithms can suggest novel products and services we didn't even know we wanted

What are some of the drawbacks?
* There are limited protections for consumers who wish to keep their data private
* Potential bias and discrimination in the data and algorithm
* New forms of social control
* Greater chance of monopolies (walled gardens of data)
* Loss of data ownership
* Some will be unfairly disadvantaged
* In the absence of comprehensive legislation, the burden of control over your digital footprint tends to fall onto the consumer
* The worker suffers the most - as power balance shifts further into the lap of the company executives, in pursuit of higher profits the employees are driven to working longer hours with poorer compensation (cf. Amazon)

## Reading Questions

Turow argues that commercial surveillance has gone too far, and makes several specific suggestions about how to strike a better balance of power between firms and consumers in the information age. Are these reforms likely to succeed?

* Encourage more corporate openness about the commercial use of people's data by naming, praising, and shaming. 
    * Getting corporations to cooperate/share data and potentially give up competitive advantage
    * Companies might see data protection as a compliance checklist
    * Naming and shaming only works if we care
    * Certain products are just too powerful to be shamed over vague questions of openess (e.g. FB, Google)
    * Manipulation
    * Restricts focus to large actors
    * Is this really effective?
    * It's cheap!
* Create an inititaive that dissects and reports on the implications of privacy policies.
    * Cost of implementation considering how fast the marketing is developing
    * Too much regulation?
    * Terms and conditions? Who cares.
* Give individuals the right to know the specific data and profile on which a retailer bases any of its targeted mesages, coupons, or other interactions.
    * Small incentive for companies to be fully transparent 
    * Companies will often not actually know this because they rely on black box algorithms
    * Too much information might render this strategy useless
    * Consent is cool!
    * It's like terms & conditions –– who's gonna read it?
    * Right to redress
    * Self-fulfilling prophecy
    * Arguably misleading
    * Exorbitant cost
    * Too complicated for consumers
    * Trade secrets
* Educate the public about digital media and marketing, beginning in middle school.
    * Digital marketing is likely to change over the years
    * Standards change through time, as frequent as every second
    * "We need more education" is a vacuous suggestion to solve any social problem

Mayer-Schönberger & Ramge argue that communicative coordination is the basis of most if not all human achievement, citing a number of architectural examples: the pyramids of Giza, the Mayan temple of Chichén Itzá, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, etc. What else do these constructions all have in common?
* SLAVES! The answer is slaves.
