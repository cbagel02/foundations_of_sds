# Week 1: Big Data and (Free Information) Markets

## Discussion Questions

Companies have always tried to target consumers to the best of their ability. How, if at all, have the internet and mobile technologies changed this dynamic? 

* Easier to access consumers through different channels
* Granularity is much higher. Creates issues about targeting individuals -- higher stakes
* Previously, companies would target consumer segments; now they can target individuals
* The use of "alternative" data sources as proxies for the desired outcome with the availability of big data and complex algorithms, raising new privacy and transparency-related issues
* More information -> target individuals
* Same(ish) goal, different technique
* More personalized
* Less costly
* More targeted segmentation of customer groups, super-fine resolution of understanding different tastes
* Scale and availability of data *(Is this a difference of degree or kind?)* 
* Difference of magnitudes can matter (film vs. photo). Perhaps the degree vs. kind distinction isn't very helpful
* Barriers to entry for small businesses have decreased
* Two-way interaction between companies and consumers
* Companies have started to create detailed customer profiles with vast amounts of personal data
* Information from biometric data may be more 'intimate' than other kinds of information, i.e. tracking of emotional expressions, sweating, heartrate feels qualitiatvely different from self-described interests on a form
* Not just the amount of data, but the complexity of the statistical/machine learning models
* The timespan has decreased dramatically
* Pricing changes immediately in response to mobile/biometric data

What are some of the benefits of data-rich markets?

* Increased efficiency
* Better matching products to users, should be good in theory for consumers and businesses 
* Better decisions 
* Improved accuracy (e.g. financial inclusion in better prediction of credit risk)
* More information
* Reputation
* More choice 
* Provides companies with better information to allow them to fulfil consumer preferences (if market works well)
* A lot of data that would not be considered otherwise now can be analyzed and factored in
* More power for consumers
* Better informed consumers 
* Platforms engender trust

What are some of the drawbacks
* Echo-chamber effect
* Loss of agency
* Concentration
* Too much information!
* Overfitting
* Inflexible algorithms can make systematic errors (e.g. financial crash)
* Privacy concerns
* Individuals can't see other options
* Selection bias
* Potential marginalisation of those not represented in the data
* Psychological harm

## Reading Questions

Turow argues that commercial surveillance has gone too far, and makes several specific suggestions about how to strike a better balance of power between firms and consumers in the information age. Are these reforms likely to succeed?
* Encourage more corporate openness about the commercial use of people's data by naming, praising, and shaming. 
    * Getting corporations to cooperate/share data and potentially give up competitive advantage
    * Companies might see data protection as a compliance checklist
    * Naming and shaming only works if we care
    * Certain products are just too powerful to be shamed over vague questions of openess (e.g. FB, Google)
    * Manipulation
    * Restricts focus to large actors
    * Is this really effective?
    * It's cheap!
* Create an inititaive that dissects and reports on the implications of privacy policies.
    * Cost of implementation considering how fast the marketing is developing
    * Too much regulation?
    * Terms and conditions? Who cares.
* Give individuals the right to know the specific data and profile on which a retailer bases any of its targeted mesages, coupons, or other interactions.
    * Small incentive for companies to be fully transparent 
    * Companies will often not actually know this because they rely on black box algorithms
    * Too much information might render this strategy useless
    * Consent is cool!
    * It's like terms & conditions –– who's gonna read it?
    * Right to redress
    * Self-fulfilling prophecy
    * Arguably misleading
    * Exorbitant cost
    * Too complicated for consumers
    * Trade secrets
* Educate the public about digital media and marketing, beginning in middle school.
    * Digital marketing is likely to change over the years
    * Standards change through time, as frequent as every second
    * "We need more education" is a pretty vacuous suggestion to solve any social problem

Mayer-Schönberger & Ramge argue that communicative coordination is the basis of most if not all human achievement, citing a number of architectural examples: the pyramids of Giza, the Mayan temple of Chichén Itzá, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, etc. What else do these constructions all have in common?
* SLAVES!
